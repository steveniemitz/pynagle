"""Aperture Load Balancer.
Based on work from finagle's aperture load balancer.
See https://github.com/twitter/finagle/blob/master/finagle-core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/loadbalancer/Aperture.scala

The aperture balancer attempts to keep the average load going into the underlying
server set between a load band (by default .5 <= load <= 2.

Load is determined via an ema of load over a smoothing window (5 seconds).
The load average is essentially the average number of concurrent requests each
node in the balancer is handling.
