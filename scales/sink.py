"""Sinks are classes that control and modify the flow of messages through the
 RPC system.

 Sinks cooperatively chain together in a linked list to form a _sink stack_.
 Each sink in the chain calls the next sink until the chain terminates.

 Scales has three types of sinks, both derived from MessageSink.
  - AsyncMessageSink:
      AsyncMessageSink handles dispatching a message down the sink chain.
      The chain is initiated by calling AsyncProcessMessage on the head.

  - ReplySink:
      ReplySink handles the message return path.  AsyncMessageSinks may optionally
      add their own ReplySink to the reply sink stack.

  - ClientChannelSink:
      ClientChannelSinks operate on a serialized data stream, representing the
      message.  Much like AsyncMessageSinks, they perform work, then delegate to
      the next sink until the chain terminates.

  Within ClientChannelSinks, there are also two specialized types:
    - ClientFormatterSink:
        A ClientFormatterSink acts as both a ClientChannelSink and AsyncMessageSink.
        It bridges the two, terminating the AsyncMessageSink chain and initiating the
        ClientChannelSink chain.  To do this, it serializes the message to a
        stream (in an implementation specific wire format), and calls its next
        sink as a ClientChannelSink.

    - ClientChannelTransportSink:
        ClientChannelTransportSinks act as the terminating sink of a sink chain.
        They take a serialized stream and handle transporting it to the downstream
        server, as well as handling the response.  Because of the fully asynchronous
        nature of the sink stack, the transport sink also is responsible for
        correlating requests to responses.
